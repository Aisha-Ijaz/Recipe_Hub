      <h2> <center> Pakistani Chicken Biryani Recipe  </center> </h2>
<p>Biryani is a beloved dish that embodies the rich culinary heritage of South Asia, particularly in countries like India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. This flavorful dish is a perfect marriage of aromatic long-grain basmati rice, tender meat (often chicken, lamb, or goat), and a symphony of spices that includes cumin, coriander, cardamom, cinnamon, and cloves. What sets biryani apart is its unique cooking method, where the rice and meat are cooked together in layers, allowing the flavors to meld beautifully. The result is a dish that is not just a meal but an experience, with each bite offering a burst of flavors and aromas that delight the senses. Biryani is often served at special occasions and celebrations, bringing people together over a shared love for good food and great company. </p>

          <li>1/2 cup Cooking Oil </li>
          <li>Spices: 2 Bay leaves, 4 Cloves, 4 Cardamom pods, 1 Cinnamon stick, 1 tsp Cumin seeds </li>

      </ul>
           
      <h3> Instructions: </h3>
      <ol> 
          <li>Rinse the basmati rice and soak it in water for 30 minutes. Drain and set aside. </li>
          <li>Heat oil in a large pot. Add sliced onions and fry until golden brown. Remove half of the fried onions and set aside for garnishing. </li>
          <li>Add ginger-garlic paste to the pot and saut√© for a few minutes until the raw smell disappears. </li>
          <li>Add chicken pieces to the pot and cook until they turn white. </li>
          <li>Add chopped tomatoes, yogurt, and spices (bay leaves, cloves, cardamom pods, cinnamon stick, cumin seeds, biryani masala, turmeric powder, red chili powder, and salt). Mix well and cook for 10-15 minutes until the chicken is cooked through and the oil separates from the masala. </li>
          <li>In another pot, bring 2 cups of water to a boil. Add the soaked and drained rice to the boiling water and cook until the rice is 70% cooked (it should still have a bite to it). </li>
          <li>Drain the partially cooked rice and layer it over the chicken masala in the pot. </li>
          <li>Sprinkle the reserved fried onions, fresh coriander, and mint leaves on top of the rice. </li>
          <li>Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid and cook on low heat (dum) for 20-25 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld and the rice to fully cook. </li>
          <li>Once done, gently fluff the biryani with a fork, making sure to mix the chicken and rice layers. </li>
          <li>Serve hot, garnished with additional fresh coriander and mint leaves if desired. </li>
      </ol>
